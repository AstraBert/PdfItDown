In the [PdfItDown GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AstraBert/PdfItDown) you can find three tutorials that cover the [three levels of PdfItDown mastery](/python-ref):

- [base_usage.ipynb](https://github.com/AstraBert/PdfItDown/tree/main/cookbooks/base_usage.ipynb) guides you through the basics of PdfItDown and how to get started with zero-effort conversions from (almost) any file format to PDF.
- [custom_usage.ipynb](https://github.com/AstraBert/PdfItDown/tree/main/cookbooks/custom_usage.ipynb) takes you to the customization layer of PdfItDown, where you can do all sort of things, bringing your own logic to the conversion. In the examples of the notebook, we go through how to create strategic PDF summaries of Google/Word Docs and how to generate news reports.
- [server.ipynb](https://github.com/AstraBert/PdfItDown/tree/main/cookbooks/server.ipynb) goes through the basics of a Starlette server, how to mount PdfItDown within it and how to send request and receive responses to and from the PdfItDown route.

Have fun!
